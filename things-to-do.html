                    <h3>A Must-Try Tradition: The Art of Mehndi</h3>
                    <p>Mehendi art, also known as henna tattooing, is a traditional form of body art in India 
                        where intricate designs are applied to the skin using a paste made from henna leaves. 
                        This art is commonly used for weddings, festivals, and special occasions. The designs can 
                        range from simple patterns to elaborate, detailed motifs, including floral, geometric, and 
                        symbolic shapes. Mehendi holds cultural significance, symbolizing beauty, joy, and prosperity, 
                        and is often applied to brides as part of the wedding rituals. The stain left by the henna can last
                         from a few days to a couple of weeks, depending on how it's applied and cared for.</p>

                        Sikh Guru. It stands as a symbol of religious tolerance and unity, welcoming people from all 
                        faiths and backgrounds. The temple is situated in the middle of a man-made pool, which reflects

                    <h3>Dive into the World of Indian Classical Dance</h3>
                    <p>Indian classical dance and music are deeply rooted in the country’s rich cultural heritage, expressing spirituality, 
                        storytelling, and emotional depth. Classical dance forms like Bharatanatyam, Kathak, Kathakali, Odissi, Kuchipudi, Manipuri, 
                        and Mohiniyattam each have unique styles, characterized by intricate footwork, graceful movements, and expressive facial gestures,
                        often narrating stories from Hindu mythology. Indian classical music, divided into Hindustani (North Indian) and Carnatic
                        traditions, is built around ragas and talas, with a strong emphasis on improvisation and emotional expression. Instruments like the 
                        sitar, tabla, veena, and mridangam are integral to these musical traditions. Both classical dance and music are considered spiritual practices, 
                        requiring years of training to master, and they remain vital to India’s artistic legacy, celebrated across the world.</p>

                        varieties like mango pickle, lemon pickle, and ginger pickle. Pickles offer a tangy, spicy, and sometimes sweet kick that complements many Indian dishes.
